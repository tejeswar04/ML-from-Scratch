# Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression, a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. In this method, the goal is to understand how the dependent variable changes with variations in two or more predictor variables. Each independent variable contributes to the overall prediction, and the model assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the response variable.

The multiple linear regression equation is expressed as:

y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₖxₖ + ε

# K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct, non-overlapping groups, or clusters. The objective is to group data points into k clusters based on their similarity, with each cluster represented by its centroid. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest centroid and updates the centroid's position until convergence. The k-means clustering process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Randomly select k data points as initial centroids.
2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming k clusters.
3. **Update Centroids**: Recalculate the centroids as the mean of data points in each cluster.
4. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or a specified number of iterations.

K-means is widely used for various applications, including customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection. It is essential to choose an appropriate value for k, the number of clusters, and interpret the results based on the context of the data being analyzed.
